# Assessment Contract

This Solidity contract, named `Assessment`, is a basic smart contract written in the Solidity programming language. It allows for depositing, withdrawing, transferring funds, and changing ownership.

## Features

- **Deposit**: Allows the owner of the contract to deposit funds into the contract.
- **Withdraw**: Allows the owner to withdraw funds from the contract, ensuring that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the contract's balance.
- **Transfer**: Allows any account to transfer funds from their account to another specified account, excluding the contract owner.
- **Change Owner**: Allows the current owner of the contract to transfer ownership to another Ethereum address.

## Usage

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., using Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle).
2. **Interacting with the Contract**:
   - Use the `deposit` function to add funds to the contract.
   - Use the `withdraw` function to withdraw funds from the contract.
   - Use the `transfer` function to transfer funds from your account to another account.
   - Use the `changeOwner` function to transfer ownership of the contract to another Ethereum address.

## Installation and Setup

To deploy and interact with the contract, you will need:
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to an Ethereum network (e.g., Ropsten, Rinkeby, or a local development network).
- Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle) for deploying and interacting with the contract.
